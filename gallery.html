<h1>My Gallery</h1>
<p>A gallery is a privately owned building or room where people can look at and buy works of art. The painting is in the gallery upstairs. A gallery is an area high above the ground at the back or at the sides of a large room or hall. A crowd already filled the gallery.</p>
<p> The most obvious function of an art gallery is to provide a physical or virtual platform for artists to exhibit their work. This exposure is crucial for artists to build their reputation and connect with audiences who are interested in learning about or purchasing their artworks.</p>
<p>To keep your gallery wall feeling interesting you're going to want to have a good mix of vertical and horizontal pieces. If your largest pieces are horizontal, try placing a smaller vertical piece next to it (centered or bottom aligned), and vice versa.</p>
